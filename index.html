            <p>I am a PhD student at the School of Mathematics of the University of Edinburgh. I am part of the SENSE CDT, a NERC Centre for Doctoral Training in satellite data for environmental science. For my PhD, I am working on applying the Instructed Glacier Model to glaciers in High Mountain Asia, using recent ice thickness observations from the region.</p>
            <p>I am a mathematician by training, having been passionate about mathematics since I was in primary school. Towards the end of my undergraduate degree, I became interested in applying mathematics to other STEM fields. After my studies, I went on to use my mathematical skills at a materials science consultancy company, before going on to do a PhD focusing on glaciology.</p>
            <p>During my PhD, I have often presented my work to internal and external colleagues (including at international conferences). As an interdisciplinary researcher, I enjoy the challenge of tailoring explanations to different audiences, and I’m always thinking of new ways to explain mathematical concepts to geoscientists and vice versa.</p>
            <p>I also have extensive Python experience, having used it in many different contexts, from undergraduate degree to research to industry. I have always had an interest in coding, and took several computer science classes during my undergraduate degree. Since starting my PhD, I have become particularly experienced with data science and geospatial analysis in Python, and machine learning packages such as Pytorch and TensorFlow. Recently I completed a data science internship at an Earth Observation data science company where I built upon my software engineering skills.</p>
